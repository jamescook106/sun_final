    <p> Civil society makes a unique contribution to the SUN movement. Here’s just some of the ways that we are supporting the fight against hunger and malnutrition: </p>
    <ul class='circles'>
      <li><b>Raising our voice</b> –  through social mobilisation, advocacy and campaigning we help to ensure that national development plans respond to the experiences of those affected by malnutrition. We work with communities to increase awareness of their right to food and nutrition. And we raise the profile of nutrition amongst decision makers and encourage governments accelerate progress. </li>
      <li><b>Building Capacity </b> – through our global network we identify and share examples of best practice in tackling malnutrition. By collecting and communicating the latest evidence we provide governments with solutions and by facilitating training to alliances we build the capacity of civil society as implementation partners.</li>
      <li><b>Monitoring Progress </b> - from a local to a global level we are tracking progress in eliminating malnutrition. We are monitoring nutrition spending, collecting data to ensure we leave no one behind and holding governments accountable to their promises.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class='circles'>
      <li>In Zambia, the SUN CSA used media campaigns and convinced MPs to form an All Party Parliamentary Caucus on food and nutrition. Nutrition was also included in manifestos and political commitments. This has been replicated by alliances in Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya as a direct result of the experience sharing with Zambia.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The Peru CSA persuaded Government to include conditions in cash transfer programs for poorest, requiring mothers to take children for medical checks. This led to a 40% drop in child malnutrition in targeted areas.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In Laos, Civil society was not well coordinated before the SUN Civil Society Alliance began work in 2014. Civil Society now has strong, credible partnership with Government and local civil society have platform for participation. The CSA helped run the first ever National Nutrition Forum for all sectors, all levels of government, civil society </li>
