  <p> We are supporting a global network of Nutrition Champions, a group of powerful advocates who are working together to end malnutrition. Our nutrition champions come from a variety of backgrounds; they may be working in their community to increase awareness of peopleâ€™s right to food, they may be training others in practical solutions to fight malnutrition, or they might be raising their voice on a global platform.</p>
